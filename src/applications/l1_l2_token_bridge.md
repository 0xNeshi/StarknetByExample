# L1 <> L2 Token Bridge

In Starknet, it is possible to interact with Ethereum by using the L1 <> L2 messaging system.

In this example, we will demonstrate the usage of this messaging system to send and receive messages from L1 to L2 for a token bridge.

```rust
{{#include ../../listings/applications/l1_l2_token_bridge/src/bridge.cairo}}
```
